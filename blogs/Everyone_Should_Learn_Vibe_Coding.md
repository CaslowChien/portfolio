# Everyone Should Learn Vibe Coding

For anyone studying a computer-science–related degree, learning vibe coding can feel terrifying. Not because it’s difficult, but because it seems to trivialize all our years of learning how to code.

I remember when DALL·E 1 first came out. I felt so privileged because no one around me understood what AI could do except me. But now, even an alien—if they exist—knows ChatGPT.

For a while, I was so upset. Why would anyone hire a junior data scientist when they have AI? What were my years of learning to code for, when a 7-year-old can now “code” what I can?

With that mindset, I started working at Vizuro, my part-time internship, where they kindly provided an AI subscription. To make my life easier, I started using that subscription, and everything changed once I accepted it as it is and began integrating AI into my everyday work.

I realized with vibe coding, I can create anything I want. These discouraging thoughts about AI turned into excitement, an eagerness to take advantage of it. Because honestly, why are you still typing `import pandas as pd` manually when AI can build you the world?

Don’t hesitate, use it. You’ll start to realize how your coding knowledge helps AI understand you far more effectively, how your programming intuition helps AI escape endless error loops, and how your understanding of databases helps you build a web app a 7-year-old cannot.
